Portuguese students are lucky that education is heavily subsidized.

Essentially, a student can go to college for free.

The University cafeteria is also subsidized.  There are three food places on campus.  Students go to the Canteen where they pay 2 euros for a balanced meal.  Most faculty go to the Grill where for 6 euros you get an upgraded version of a full tray of food.  There is also a Restaurant where you have a full restaurant experience.  It's either 7 euros for ordering a main dish, or 11 euros for a buffet.

There are several cafe place with simple bakeries.
