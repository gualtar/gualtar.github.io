title: The buses
---

I probably have taken buses in Braga for over one hundred times so far and have gained some basic sense of how it works.  

Especially after getting my monthly pass, I started using my instinct rather than relying on schedule provided by Google Map.  Unfortunately, today was not my day.  I got on the wrong bus twice.

I got on 24 after my dental appointment, was not expecting it to run further and further away from the city before it finally came around.

Then after work, I got on 41, which pass right by our apartment but took a detour that cost extra 30 minutes.
