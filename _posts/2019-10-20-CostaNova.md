Before Wiliam got up, I took a morning walk around the town.  Should have jogged instead to cover more places.

We were pleasantly surprised to find the hotel we stayed had free breakfast.  It's simple but functional.

A local people who enjoy sunsine at the bus station told us the time for the next busto Costa Nova, and pointed out the posted schedule was for summer time only.  A woman from Singapore said she had sat there for two hours. The bus ride was comfortable, going around places before it reached the beach town.  

Costa Nova is famous for its colorful stripe-painted houses.  I would say the beach was even nicer.  William got his shoes wet within a couple of minutes.  Still he nejoyed chasing cats and talk to a dog who was hiding under the deck.

We caught the bus just in time to hop to Farol where you see the tallest lighthouse in Portugal.  We at at the Miami Burger \& Stake, probably the best burgers in Portugal, then spent about two minutes to appreciate the lighthouse.

Getting out of the bus at the city center, we were about 15 minutes by walk to the train station with about two hours left.  We walked slowed through the old city.  On our way, we tour the Monastery of Jesus.

When we reached Braga, we found the ground was wet.  Rains!
