After having breakfast at the IBIS hotel we walked to tour the University of Coimbra.

The Universidade de Coimbra is the starting point of higher education in Portugal and for hundreds of years the only university in Portugal.  It was founded in 1290 and settled down at current location in 1537.

As the oldest university in Portugal, Coimbra is responsbile for forming and shaping many of the campus cultrue and traditions that would be later adopted by universities such as Lisboa and Minho.  There was a recent article in the newspaper about its president's reflection on tradition of hazing.

Last time when William had his phone stolen in Lisboa, the officer at the police station encouraged us to visit her honmetown Coimbra and the University of Coimbra.
