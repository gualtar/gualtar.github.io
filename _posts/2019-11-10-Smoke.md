title: The Fire Alarm
---

We triggered the fire alarm in the building when William cooked burgers in the oven.

Unlike the smoke detectors we had before, this one would not stop after the smoke dispersed.  It sounded alarms in the entire building.  It was incredibly loud, but no one came out.  We texted our agent and she quickly replied with instructions to reset the alarm at a control panel downstairs.  We did that, but we couldn't clear the false alarm beeping which continued on.  Our agent told us the smoke detector was super-sensitive.  Once it was activated by a bread toast.

We felt terrible for the incidence.  

We noticed in every apartment we have stayed, there was a first aid kit and a disaster kit.  I assume that must be required by law.

According to Wikipedia, the homicide rate of Portugal is 0.70, in comparison to 2.10 of Morocco and 5.30 of the US.

Living Portugal feels safe.
