title: The Fire Alarm
---

We triggered the fire alarm in the building when William cooked burgers in the oven.

Unlike the smoke detectors we had before, this one would not stop after the smoke dispersed.  It sounded alarms in the entire building.  It was incredibly loud, but no one came out.  We texted our agent and she quickly replied with instructions to reset the alarm at a control panel downstairs.  We did that, but we couldn't clear the false alarm beeping which continued on.  Our agent told us the smoke detector was super-sensitive.  Once it was activated by a bread toast.

We felt terrible for the incidence.  

We noticed in every apartment we have stayed, there was a first aid kit and a disaster kit.  I assume that must be mandated by law.

According to Wikipedia, the homicide rate of Portugal is 0.70, in comparison to 2.10 of Morocco and 5.30 of the US.

Last night, LSU beat Alabama 46:41 in a road game attended by President Trump, a Nick Saban's fan.  Last year, Alabama shutout LSU 29:0 at the Tiger Stadium while LSU was ranked No. 3 in the nation.  LSU hadn't won a game against Alabama in the last eight years.  Saban was LSU's coach before he told LSU he was going to NFL, but actually went to Alabama.  LSU coach Ed Orgeron, a Louisiana native, summed it up at a post game locker room speech, "Roll Tide. What? F You!"

Today William wore an LSU hoodie in celebration of the win.
