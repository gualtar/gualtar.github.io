William had a headache when he got up in the morning.  We has the first sick day.

In the Portuguese class, I was unexpectedly called to give the _objeto_ presentation, as you describe an object without telling the audience what it is.  I made up a few sentences in Google Translate about the laptop.  We will have the final exam next week and I am not prepared at all.

On my way home, I dropped by the Chinese store and finally got some dumplings which were really good.  Actually, it was better than any of the frozen dumplings I could find in the US which were made in US and China.  The dumplings were made in Portuguese.  It appears to be handmade but in perfect shape.  I asked the owner about their hours on Sunday.  The ower said they opened.  This was the second time I found them closed but they insisted that they had opened on Sunday.
