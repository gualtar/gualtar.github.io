The CLIB school is about 15 minutes uphill from the University.  I often cut through a narrow path that only allows pedestrians.  In the middle of that path, there is a house I often hear sound of a childcare or school.  It may be a canteen.  It is possibly also a day center for seniors.

I would later saw the vans running around picking up residents from their homes in the morning.  Gultar was an rural parish.  It's infrastructure is excellent.  I would say it's better than that of the Yanbeiyuan, a community of professors of Beijing University in Beijing and Tianhuali, a community of professors in Tianjin.
