The week-long rain stopped approximately five minutes after our train arrived at Aveiro station, but not before the wind broke William's umbrela we bought at a Chinese store.

Google Map does not show a bus route to our hotel, which is about 15 minutes from the station.  It sits right in the center of the city, but otherwise is hidden in a back alley.  The lobby is so small that only four persons could squeeze in.  While we waited at the line of the 'short' line, people arriving later had to stook outside of the entrance.  Despite the size, it is a full-flege hotel with a restaurant, public restrooms, and even a nail salon between the first and second floors.  Our room barely fits two twin beds placed side by side, but it is also completed with a small desk, a stoll, a closet, and a narrow but long balcony wraping around the coner.

The lady at the reception desk took a good seven  minutes recording my passport information in a long form.  Paused a few times to think but she was able to completed it in the end.  In Portugal you can't go anywhere without the passport.  Long distance buses and train tickets all require passport information.  And they actually read the passport carefully.
