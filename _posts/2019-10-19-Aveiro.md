The week-long rain stopped approximately five minutes after our train arrived at Aveiro station, but not before the wind broke William's umbrela we bought at a Chinese store.

Google Map does not show a bus route to our hotel, which is about 15 minutes from the station.  It sits right in the center of the city, but otherwise is hidden in a back alley.  The lobby is so small that only four persons could squeeze in.  While we waited at the line of the 'short' line, people arriving later had to stook outside of the entrance.  Despite the size, it is a full-flege hotel with a restaurant, public restrooms, and even a nail salon between the first and second floors.  Our room barely fits two twin beds placed side by side, but it is also completed with a small desk, a stoll, a closet, and a narrow but long balcony wraping around the coner.

The lady at the reception desk took a good seven  minutes recording my passport information in a long form.  Paused a few times to think but she was able to completed it in the end.  In Portugal you can't go anywhere without the passport.  Long distance buses and train tickets all require passport information.  And they actually read the passport carefully.

Wiliam bought one crepe, then another one.  The owner proudly invited us to video while the cook made it.

We came back to the hotel to get a voucher which saved us one euro for the boat tour. We got on a boat with the red company.  I think our boat is the best looking.  At the end of one branch canal, there was a brick factory building with a tall brick chimney, which reminded me of a boat tour in Augusta, GA.  The tour took a good 45 minutes.  The guide was nice to give William and I English explanations besides using Portugues to the rest of the guests.

We had dinner at the Chinese placed called Origami.  It was rated very high (4.7 out of 5) on Google and it turnned out very good.  The sign on the door says it opens at 6 pm, but we were not able to get in until around 6:20 when a man opened the doors.  He was the owner.  The food was tasty and the owner was very considerate.  We left at around 9 pm as the only guests in a rather large restaurant.  In the mean time, only one take out person dropped by.  While we were getting out, a couple were walking in.  I hope they have better business.
