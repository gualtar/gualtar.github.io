When I went pick up William from CLIB after school, he said he would need to skip the swimming practice today in order to prepare for a math exam tomorrow.  A little girl was using her umbrella to poke William.  I told her to stop because that was dangerous.

William's academic journey at CLIB has been a bumpy ride.  He opted out of Spanish, which was taught in Portuguese, and History.  The class he loves the most is Geography, alas he did not receive good grades.  English is easy for him for obvious reason.  He managed to get a low grade from P.E., but he did not know why.  He floundered in a Science exam because according to him we missed two classes when traveling to Lisboa last time.  The one class he stands out is LTR.  He told me the teacher said in class that William was the best student he had in ten years.  He is leading a group project to raise money for homeless people.  He said he would have to work harder because of the elevated duty and responsibility.

William made some tidy notes of his Math classes.  He spent some time went over his notes.  He also went to the Khan Academy and did some exercises.  William went to bed a little earlier and planned on getting up early in the next morning.
