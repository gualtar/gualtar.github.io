My school (CLIB) has interesting breaks, at the end of the term we have a one week break from school and that time has now come. 

It's Friday and the break is now at hand. One week of basically vacation, heaven for any kid. We (My dad and I) are going to Morocco.  I really don't want to go because I've seen reviews and everywhere reeks of weed, but I guess he didn't research anything and chose based on closest to us. We're supposed to leave on Wednesday and get back on Saturday and now I have to fear the chance of getting high from standing on the street for too long. 

So that's kinda it, I'll probably play with my friends for most of the break too but yeah, that's it.
