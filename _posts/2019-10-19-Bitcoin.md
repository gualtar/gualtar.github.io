Over the weekend Dad and I went to Aveiro.  On the first day we explored the city and went on a boat tour. The tour was about 45 minutes and we got a 1 dollar discount on the tickets because of our hotel.  The tour guide was super friendly and told us about all the historic buildings and important monuments/stuff like that in English and then told everyone else all of the stuff in Portuguese.

We saw a factory turned town hall and even a Bitcoin bar, I don't know what that was, maybe everything at the bar was worth 8,219.12 dollars. Like they had 24 karat gold Manchado de Jabugo(The most expensive ham in the world). I also got a couple of pictures that looked like I was in Japan.

The boat ride in general was very beautiful and for dinner we went to a Chinese place which had really pretty paintings/sculptures/works of glass. The people were really nice and I saw this Chinese TV show that was a singing show like The Voice.
