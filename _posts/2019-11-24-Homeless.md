title: Christmas Card for Homeless People

William made a huge Christmas card for homeless people in Portugal.  It is part of his school project with three other students at CLIB.

The other students did a rough sketch, and William finalized them and colored them.  William was very serious becuase, it was for the homeless people.

I did some housework and went grocery shopping at Pingo Doce.  I went to the Chinese grocery store at 1:30 pm, but it was closed with this patched up hand-written sign.

I came back at two it was still closed, perhaps it was not open on Sunday.
