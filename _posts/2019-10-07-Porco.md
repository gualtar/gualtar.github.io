As Chinese, we feel Portuguese people's love of pork.  A few doors from our apartment downtown, an upscale restaurant prominantly displayed them at their antrance.  Because my Chinese horoscope is pig, William often joked about all my cousins in the display window.

Like the many bakery shops, you can find many butcher's shops with large cut chunk of pig niced arranged along business streets.

In 2015, per capita pork consumptions in Portugal is 45.2 kg, or 99.6 lbs.  The corresponding numbers for China and the US are 90.1 lbs and 64.3 lbs.

I am happy and relieved to be able to get away from the chicken country the US because I do not eat them.

Talking about chicken.  The rooster is the national symbol of Portugal.  But from this picture you may see Portuguese people give pig and childen equal love.
