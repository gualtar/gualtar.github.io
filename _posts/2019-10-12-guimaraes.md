Guimaraes is often referred to as the cridle of Portugal.  Twenty-five minuts away by bus from Braga city, Guimaraes is another major metropolitan in Portugal.

We rode the Rodonorte bus and arrived at the Guimaraes bus station in only twenty minutes.  A Uber took us to the tayed at the Stay Hotel.
