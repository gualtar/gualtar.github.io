Guimaraes is often referred to as the cridle of Portugal.  Twenty-five minuts away by bus from Braga city, Guimaraes is another major metropolitan in Portugal.

We rode the Rodonorte bus and arrived at the Guimaraes bus station in only twenty minutes.  A Uber took us to the tayed at the Stay Hotel.

This looks just like the Liberdade Raod in Braga.

We took a cable car to the top of the mountain which has a nice overview of the city and beyond.  William enjoyed playing with an arcade which measures your punching strength.  We saw many mountain bikers rode the cable to the top and speed down.

We had a best Chinese dinner since coming to Portugal at a place called Bamboo Garden.  The food tast like authentic and the crew functions like a well-oiled machine.  Dishes came to the table within minutes if not seconds.  In the end, the owner offered us a discount.
