Today we went to the all familiar IKEA.  It's the first store we visited in Portugal that we had known before and it felt like home.

We bought a desk and a bookshelf for our new apartment that we are moving in, which will be our temporary home in the next three months.  We also bought a charger with the Portuguese socket and some hangers.  William bought Panda.  We then had a lunch at the cafeteria.  We were somehow disappointed that the IKEA at the mall did not have the Sweden beverage and did not even have the meatballs.  Instead, they have a English breakfast with orange juice.  Their wine does not taste good, or to paraphrase, does not taste like Portuguese wine.

We tried to get a Uber XL, but were not able to.  It seems there was only one Uber XL in the entire Braga area.  The driver called on my cell phone to tell me he would had to recharge.

Fortunately, the next Uber X was a compact SUV (Nissan Rogue).  The driver helped us to put the boxes in his car.  The driver told us he was a civil engineering student at the University of Minho.
