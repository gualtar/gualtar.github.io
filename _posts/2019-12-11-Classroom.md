Today I visited Dr. Paulo's Computer System class.  

The room was almost full.  As I counted there were about 33 students.  In the front there is a big smart board, which is very impressive.

The class started at 9:10 am.  A few students were late, but no more than 5 minutes.  Joao's slides uses large fonts to my like.  Students are allowed to use laptops but as I saw they were all focused on the slides.

I made annual donations to Hood College and the Sustainable Horizon Institute.
