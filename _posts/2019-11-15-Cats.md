There are many cats roaming around in the city of Braga.

Today when I was waiting for Bus 24, this kitty came to me and asked me to pet it.  

We lost Internet connection in our apartment.  I checked the modem and the router in the storage closet.  I tried rebooting the boxes and reconnect the fiber cable but neither worked.

The housing agent said the earlist time to have a service person out would be the next Tuesday, four days laster.

One interesting observation I made was, when the internet worked, the speed test usually showed a much higher speed for upload (in the range of 40--60 Mbps) than download (in the range of 10--20 Mbps).  I saw tthe same in both our current apartment and the previous AirBNB place.  On the other hand, even when it worked and the 20 Mbps were not terribly slow, my laptop often struggled to keep a Zoom meeting.  It seems something that couldn't be measured by the download speed that were causing trouble all the time.
