We went to the Porto Airport only to find our flight had been canceled.

It's probably my fault because I did not check before we went.  However, Royal Air Moroc never sent us a message while they changed our schedule in the back end and rebooked us to a flight on the next day.

I got to go to the Portuguese class at the University and William got to go swimming practice.

We missed the SPEAK class as they moved it back to Wednesday.
