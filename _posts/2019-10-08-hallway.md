Today is my bump-into-randome-people day.  I did not find a watercooler point, so I just walked into some offices if the door was open.

I chatted with Jose, who had already retired, functional programming.  Paulo and Carlos who are in distributed systems.

With some time left after having early dinner at Mario and Josey's place, William and I walked to the swimming pool.  On the way, William adimred some nice houses.

There are many this kind of newspaper stand in the street.  They remind me of chidhood life in Tianjin, China.  I think they have been disappering in most places in China.
