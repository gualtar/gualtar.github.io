Today is my bump-into-random-people day.  I did not find a water cooler point, so I just walked into some offices if the door was open.

I chatted with Jose, who had already retired, functional programming.  Paulo and Carlos who are in distributed systems.

With some time left after having early dinner at Mario and Josey's place, William and I walked to the swimming pool.  On the way, William admired some nice houses.

There are many this kind of newspaper stand in the street.  They remind me of childhood life in Tianjin.  I think they had since been disappearing in most places in China.  On the side panel of the roof, it reads: tobaccos, newspapers, magazines, ice cream, soda, cards, and books.
