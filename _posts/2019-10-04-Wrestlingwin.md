After the swimming practice, William had a wrestling match with his friend Rafael.  Rafael's father Rui was the director of the Karate Club under the Sporting Club de Braga, aka SCBraga.  Rui was very helpful and instrumental to get William in the competition swimming team.

William won easily.

Afterwards, we went to a Chinese restaurant where they had an extensive menu of Chinese pastry.  William really like it and we would come back a few more times.
