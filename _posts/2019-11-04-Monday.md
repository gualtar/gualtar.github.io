In the morning, William woke up with a sore throat.  We decided to stay home for the day just to be safe.  William had a lot of water and more sleep.

I went to the Portuguese class in the afternoon.  We got to have a joint class with students in a higher level Portuguese class.  My partner was a Master program exchange student from Italy who studied English.  She is fluent in Spanish and it certain gives her an advantage in learning Portuguese.

The instructors played and explained a music video _Pequeno T2_.  It's too hard for my level.

I then went to the lab to find out arrangement for my talk and other some other work.

On my way home, I went to the grocery store to buy some vegetables and food that William would eat.

In the evening, William and I worked together to catch up work on some journals for the past few days.

Of course, it was raining hard.
