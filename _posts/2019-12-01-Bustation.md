title: We missed our bus
---

We were not able to go to Ponte de Lima because the computer system at the bus station were not working and the bus left without us.

William enjoyed some quality time at the ice rink.

William was the team lead for a class project.  The rest of the team are two girls from Form 5 and two boys from Form 6.  He spent more than 20 hours over the weekend on a group project alone.

I advanced to the _Pearl League_ in the Duolingo App.

We were finally able to get in the Chinese grocery store on a Sunday.  At the store, we met a Chinese teacher we knew from the University.  We also met a student and his girlfriend.  He bought some dried noodles and a pack of instant noodle.  Evidently the Chinese store was also frequented by local Portuguese people.

As we went grocery shopping at another Pingo Doce, another group of students from another school were handing out bags to patrons, William filled a full bag of good.  He got some on sale big box of cereals.  It will feed a lot of people.
