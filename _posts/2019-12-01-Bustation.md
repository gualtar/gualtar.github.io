title: We missed our bus
---

We were not able to go to Ponte de Lima because the computer system at the bus station were not working and the bus left without us.

William enjoyed some quality time at the ice rink.

William was the team lead for a class project.  The rest of the team are two girls from Form 5 and two boys from Form 6.  He spent more than 20 hours over the weekend on a group project alone.

I advaned to the _Pearl League_ in the Duolingo App.
