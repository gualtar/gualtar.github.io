We had two Portuguese classes today.  

At the class at the University of Minho, 14 students showed up, out of 37 registered students and about 10 less than those who regularly attended.

At the SPEAK class, we have four students, including William and I, out of a registered enrollment of 10.

Learning Portuguese is hard.  It's probably a seasonal progressive development towards the end of the semester and incoming exams in two weeks.

Or, perhaps they are sick because of seasonal flu.

Other seasonal stuff going on was an International lunch this coming Sunday at the CLIB and a Swedish party at an expat's house in December.
