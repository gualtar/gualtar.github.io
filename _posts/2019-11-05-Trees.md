William lost two teeth in the past two weeks.  He asked the tooth fairy for two dollars which I happily complied.

William donated the two dollars to [#teemtrees](https://teamtrees.org/).  The TeamTrees is a grassroots climate preserve effort started by Youtuber Mr. Beast and promoted by a major donation from Elon Mask.  They promise to plant one tree for every single dollar they received.  William's shout-out-message was 

```It's ain't much but it's honest work.```

"It's a meme", William explained to me.
