William lost two teeth in the past two weeks.  He asked the tooth fairy for two dollars which I happily complied.

William donated the two dollars to [#teemtrees](https://teamtrees.org/).  William's shout-out-message was 
```It's ain't much but it's honest work.```
It's a meme, William explained to me.
