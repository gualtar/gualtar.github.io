William has been complaining about his right ear.  There was a small pimples that appeared in his ear.  He kept rubbing it for days and now it was an infection.

I went to a local pharmacy and spoke to a very nice pharmacist.  She got William antibiotics.  She paid with her own money to get William weighed so that she could calculate the proper dosage.  The next day I came back to get painkillers for William.  She still remembered William's weight.  The medications cost very little, about a few bucks.  However, they are not flavored and they taste awful.

The Portuguese word for being 'nice' is simpatica.
