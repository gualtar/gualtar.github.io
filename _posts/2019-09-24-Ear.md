William has been complaining about his right ear.  There was a small pimples that appeared in his ear.  He kept rubbing it for days and now it was an infection.

I went to a pharmacy and spoke to a very nice pharmacist.  She got William painkillers and antibiotics.  She paid with her own money to get William weighed so that she could calculate the proper dosage.

The Portuguese word for being 'nice' is simpatica.
