We took trains to Vianan, transfer at Nine.

A rainbow followed our train for over an hour.  It's actually a double rainbow although the picture was not clear.

As we were on top of the basilica, a rain cloud passed us.  We saw the scene that part of the world was in rain and the other side was sunny from atop.

William enjoyed the zip line in the playground by the river.  We returned there for one more time and spent over an hour.

As we were stepping out of the costume museum, I heard someone was singing a Chinese song.  This was a typical example of the bar test in NPL.
