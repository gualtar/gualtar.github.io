Houses in Portugal are built with stones and they stand for a long time.  It's a common scene to see abandoned houses with no roofing.  They look hundreds of years ago.  The wooden houses in the US would have collapsed a long time ago.  Often, they blended in with other old houses so well that you wouldn't tell even when walking next to a house ruin.
