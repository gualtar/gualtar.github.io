Xinlian began the day with a productive meeting with Professor Pedro manuel Rangel santos Henriques, the chairperson of the Department of Informatica at University of Minho.  Pedro gave a datailed introduction to the department and invited Xinian to the retiredment party for Professor Jose Manuel Valenca.  We shard our experiences and observations on teaching, research, and administration in Portugal and in the US.

Xinlian went to a Meetup to meet the local Data Science community.  The meetup is at the Centro Empresarial de Braga at 6:30 pm.  Xinlian was alerted about this event by Sergio Silva, a PhD student he met at a SPEAK event.
