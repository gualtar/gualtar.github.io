Dr. Biswas asked us whether we would like to join them for the Free Walking Tour during her visit to Braga.  That's a good idea.  We haven't done that even though we had lived here for quite a while.  The tour starts at the New Gate which is 2 minutes away from our apartment and ends at the Republic Square 3 minutes away.  It would be a great opportunity to review and reflect on our community.  

The tour took over two hours.  Our tour guide was a local resident who spoke excellent English.  There are two groups, one for a European students group with over 40 people, and the other for six of us.
