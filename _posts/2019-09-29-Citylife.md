Today is the last day of our stay at the Roman Imperio place.

In the morning, we ran into an old couple of American tourists at a restaurant steps away from our new apartment.  It turned out that the chef was the winner of a competition.  We tried a desert, but it turned out to be too sweet for William.  We took a photo together.

As we walked by the saqure by the city hall, we saw a festival thing going on.  We stayed in the city to get a city life and cultural exposures.  We were gald on our correct decision.
