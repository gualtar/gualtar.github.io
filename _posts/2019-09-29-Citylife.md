Today is the last day of our stay at the Imperio Roman on Liberdade.  It's really at a primer location.  We will miss it.  Nelson the owner told us to leave the windows open on our way out.  I was worried about the incoming rain but Nelson said he would be there soon before the rain came.

In the morning, we ran into an old couple of American tourists at a restaurant steps away from our new apartment.  It turned out that the Chef Cris Mota was the winner of [Hell's Kitchen](https://vejasp.abril.com.br/blog/arnaldo-lorencato/hell-8217-s-kitchen-cris-e-a-vitoriosa-no-programa-apresentado-por-danielle-dahoui/).  She is the first woman ever to win in that show after four seasons.  William enjoyed his spaghetti.  We tried a famous desert, but it turned out to be too sweet for William.  We took a photo together.

There are game stands, vendors, shows, state performance, and craftsmanship demonstrations.  We saw a panel but couldn't read the Portuguese words.  

As we walked by the square by the city hall, we saw a festival thing going on.  We stayed in the city to get a city life and cultural exposures.  We were happy with our right decision.
