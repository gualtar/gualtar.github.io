We joined Dr.~Biswas near the Se.

We browsed the flea market, where William bought a bottle of colorful sand handcrafted in Brazil.

We enjoyed the Little Portugal, where they had a miniature University of Coimbra quad.

We had some good burger at a restaurant with good view of the city across the river.
