Our train was over one hour late when it arrived at the Coimbra-B station.  We then took another five-minute train ride to the Coimbra station which sits at the center of the city.

Our hotel Ibis Coimbra Centro was small but functional.  Walking to Ibis, we saw many posters of people who looked like politicians and they were all egged with no exception.

We saw some University students singing in the downtown.  Their school uniform was not as elaborated as those of the University of Minho.  We joined Dr. Biswas near the Se.  We saw a large number of bikers.  On our way down, we appreciated many interesting graffiti.

We browsed the flea market, where William bought a bottle of colorful sand handcrafted in Brazil.

We enjoyed the Little Portugal, where they had a miniature University of Coimbra quad.

We had some good burgers at a restaurant with good view of the city across the river.
