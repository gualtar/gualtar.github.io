I arrived at the Embassy at the wrong gate.  The security and the guards were kind to let me in.  The PR Office sent a guy to pick me up.  

We learned some interesting knowledge from the Embassy.  Many people lost their passports in Portugal.  The US Embassy had developed a fast track process that they could print a new temporary passport in fifteen minutes.  It would be good for three months.  Falling from height is not an uncommon hazard for US tourists in Portugal, especially students.

We did not get to meet with the ambassador.

On our way back, we noticed the train ride was incredibly shaky near Porto.  We were worried the train might derail.
