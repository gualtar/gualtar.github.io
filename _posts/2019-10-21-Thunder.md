After non-stop rain for an entire week, weather forecast shows Monday to Wednesday rain-free.  

Naturally, I did not bring an umbrella on Monday morning.  Approximately 4:22 pm, while we were at the Portugues class, there was this incredible loud thunder that rocked the classroom. And it was followed by down pouring rain.

Having heard the first thunder of the year in Portugal (for me), I also saw the firstrainbow.  "There is a jar of honey at the of every rainbow," I told a little Chinese girl who was waiting for bus with her Dad, "and Winnie-the-Pooh knows about that."

After the rain, everything looks refreshed, and it looks like autumn has come.

Today we saw a transportatiob employee checking tickets on the bus for the first time.
