Time to tighten up some loose ends from our walking tour yesterday.

We had coffee with Dr. Biswas at Cafe Vianna, the street political center for local residents.  William had a gigantic ice cream crepe, and it made him temporarily forget the ice cream in bubble waffles.

I went to the Bananeiro to have a shot of Muscat wine with a banana for 1.60 euros.

I went to the Imaging Museum, which was free and hosted a nice collection of portraits.  The clerk did not speak English, but she tried her best and went out of her way to show me some historic artifacts they had, including their log book with entries starting 1910.  Alas, you can't get on top of the medieval tower.

I went to a casa dos crivos, which was now used as a public gallery.  It hosted a collection of illustrated postcards alluding to typical Braga expressions.  It is part of an illustration meeting 'Braga at Risk' held by the Braga municipality.  National artists worked on themes such as _older than the Se_, _See Braga through a Straw_, _Penico do CÃ©u_, and _City of Archbishops_.

I went to the Braga Castle.  There was a sign saying opening hours 14:00 -- 17:50.  I found it  closed when I got there at 3 pm.

The Edificio Do Castelo was hosting an art exhibition inside.  The poster making guy returned and was welcomed by many children.  Some grownups took a workshop on making pin-hole cameras.

They set also up a big tent which was used to make a huge pin-hole camera.  Somebody obviously traced the pinhole image with markers directly on the tent.  Not sure whether it was the organizer or some naughty kids, or naughty grownups.

I still couldn't locate the two roosters at the Holy Cross Church, can you?
