Time to follow up the leads on the city mentioned by our tour guide yesterday.

We had coffee with Dr. Biswas at Cafe Vianna, the local political center.  William had a gigantic ice cream crepe.

I went to the Bananeiro to have a shot with a banana for 1.60 euros.

I went to the Imaging Museum, which was free.  Alas, you can't get on top of the medieval tower.

I went to a casa dos crivos, which was used as a public gallery.  It hosted some interesting works from local artists.

I went to the Braga Castle.  There was a sign saying opening hours 14:00 -- 17:50.  It was closed and no trace that it had been opened in quite some time.  

The Edificio Do Castelo was hosting an art exhibition inside.  The poster making guy returned and was welcomed by many children.  Some grownups took a workshop on making pin-hole cameras.  They set up a big tent which was used to make a huge pin-hole camera.

I went to the Holy Cross Church, but still couldn't find the two roosters.
