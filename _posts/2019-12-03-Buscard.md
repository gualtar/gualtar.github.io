I lost my bus card.

It's a big hassle, not the least because it was the first day of the month so I just paid for the monthly fee.  With the card, I just get on any bus without thinking about the fare or distance.  It enabled me mindlessly roaming around in the city.

I also have a multi-ride card, which I refill with certain number of rides at the TUB's campus office at half price.  However, I will have to estimate my needs and count my rides.  In addition, there are two zones and some buses goes across zones.  It will always be a puzzle for me to decipher whether I should do zone one or zone two.  And, it's a hassle for the bus driver too because they will need to manually set the reader every time.

William obtained a document from his school for his bus card.
