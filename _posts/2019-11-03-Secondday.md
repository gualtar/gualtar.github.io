Today is our second day in Marrakesh.

We were awoken by the prayer call from many minarets that we were surrounded.  But the loudest source of sound was still the musics from the square.  They are as loud and vibrant as how we remembered it before we fell asleep last night.  We are just used to the music, I guess.

## More Souks

We had breakfast at the small dinning room next to the pool.

We planned to go to the palace but we would need to go to an ATM to get some cash.

## The Museum

We then went to the school which was nearby.  Unfortunately, it was under renovation.  We visited the Marrakesh museum instead.  

## Second Day in Casablanca

We went to a modern mall.

## Back to home in Braga
