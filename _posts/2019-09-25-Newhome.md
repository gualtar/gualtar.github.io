Today William took a look at our new home on the Rua Dom Afonso Henriques.  It is steps away from the Se, the ultimate center of the historic town center of Braga.  From the balcony, we see church towers.

On our way back, a choo-choo train passed by.

It took us several trips to move our suitcases, groceries, and other items.

We tried out a new place where they had burgers and affordable.  It is a place for the locals that we have been searching for.  It is close to the guest house, alas we are moving away.
