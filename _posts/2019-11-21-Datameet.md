Today I went to a Data Science Meetup event held at the Departamento de Informatica, one level downstairs from the lab I worked at.  A professor from University of Porto gave a talk about using mRNA sequencing to identify gene expression profile postmortal.  A researcher from the CS Department of University of Minho talked about using DL on compound structures.

When I picked up William, he was playing soccer with his best buddies in the class.  William worked on his geography project until 1 am.
