Today I had a dental appointment in the morning, so I got to walk in  downtown in daytime, after riding bus back and forth between Braga and Gualtar to send William to CLIB.

It seems Portugues really love writing on the wall.  You can't find a single wall that hasn't been painted over in the southern city of Faro.  The first graffiti I saw was I want happiness.
