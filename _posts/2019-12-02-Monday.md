Today is yet another Monday.

We left our apartment at 10 am and was able to get to CLIB well before 10:10, when the third class of William started.  It was a little more than two miles after all.  Still, on a normal day it would have cost us an hour on bus.  Taking a Uber won't save too much time in rush hours either.

While I need to prepare slides for my talk at the LBL geospatial meeting, William has a number of assignment due.  We started short of time and knew it would be a long day.

We were very happy to see Rosey at the pizzzaria.  She's not fully recovered yet but in good spirit.
