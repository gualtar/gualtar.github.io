Contrary to some online articles, the origin of the name Casablanca is Portuguese, not Spanish.  I was happy to learn that as it seems to make it closer to home.

We woke up to the magnificence of the Hassan II Mosque from our balcony:

The hotel breakfast was impressive with plenty of various local flavors and made-to-order omelet.  I saw two young women enjoying their breakfast in  very dressy dresses and minutes later saw them again checking-out with 80L daypacks.  Only in Morocco, I guess.

We walked toward the mosque but obviously it was not the common tourists entry.  There were policemen with full-length assault rifles guarding the place.  They saluted to some senior officers as they drove by checking security.

The mosque only accept grouped tours.  For those do not come with a tour guide, a guide is provided at certain times in a day.  We arrived at around 9:20.  While waiting for our tour at 10, we visited a small museum at the visitor center.  We saw some tourists entered the museum without purchasing a ticket.  They were located by the security and escorted out of the property.

The museum talked about the construction of the mosque with samples of materials and styles.  It is a good source of information, which will be appreciated even more after visiting the actual mosque.

People were started letting in the mosque when it was close to 10.  They were posted signs for tourists speaking different languages.  While waiting for people to gather, we ran into a young man from Colorado who was traveling alone.  He said he had been in Morocco for ten days and would go to Fez in the afternoon.  I asked about his experience in Marrakesh.  He said he just ignored all the locals who had hassled him into things and tricks.

The main hall is amazing.  It holds 20,000 men, with capacity for additional 5,000 women in a separate hall.  It was deigned by a French architect who was the friend of the king and made of all Morocco materials except the chandeliers and two white columns.  

Afterwards, we were led to the level beneath which was a huge wash room.

As we walked out of the mosque, the weather was just perfect.

We checked out of our hotel and got another Careem to get to the Casa Voyageurs train station, which was the main train station of Casablanca and was further away from us.  Our captain spoke good English and explained to us the differences between the small red taxis and larger white-and-green taxis.  Red taxis can only go to local destinations while the larger ones can go to other places.  William also observed that the larger ones were kept in better conditions in general.
