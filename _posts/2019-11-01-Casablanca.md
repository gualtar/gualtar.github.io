Contrary to some online sources, the origin of the name _Casablanca_ is Portuguese, not Spanish.  I was happy to learn about this because it seems to make it closer to home.

We woke up to the magnificence of the Hassan II Mosque from our balcony:

The hotel breakfast was impressive with plenty of varieties of local flavors and made-to-order omelet.  I saw two young women enjoying their breakfast in very dressy dresses and minutes later saw them again checking-out with 80L daypacks.  Only in Morocco, I guess.

## The Hassan II Mosque

We walked toward the mosque but obviously it was not the common tourists entry.  There were quite some policemen with full-length assault rifles guarding the place.  They saluted to senior officers as they drove around checking security.  We saw a large number of armed soldiers and policemen at the airports, rail stations, and palaces.  

The mosque only accept grouped tours.  A guide is provided for individual tourists at certain times in a day outside of time to pray.  We arrived at around 9:20 am.  While waiting for our tour at 10, we visited a small museum at the visitor center.  We saw some international tourists entered the museum without purchasing a ticket.  They were located by the security guard and escorted out of the property.  The museum tickets are only a couple of dollars.  You would wonder why did they do that.  Perhaps just because they could.

The museum talked about the construction of the mosque with samples of building materials and design styles.  It is a good source of information, which will be appreciated even more after visiting the actual mosque.

Close to 10 am, people started gathering around the entrance which was located to the west side of the main hall.  Some lined up to take photos with mosaic-decorated fountains.

From afar, we could see the El Hank lighthouse in the morning mist.  It was built in 1916 and towering at 167 ft high.  That was where you find the beach of Casablanca, that you can reach by light rail lines.

People were started letting in the mosque.  There were posted signs for tourists speaking different languages.  While waiting for people to gather, we ran into a young man from Colorado who was traveling alone.  He said he had been in Morocco for ten days and would go to Fez in the afternoon.  I asked about his experience in Marrakesh.  He said he just ignored all the locals who had hassled him into things and tricks.  "Just don't trust them."

The main hall is amazing.  It holds 20,000 men, with capacity for additional 5,000 women in a separate section.  It was deigned by a French architect who was the friend of the king and made of all Morocco materials except the chandeliers and two white columns.  

Afterwards, we were led to the level beneath which was a huge wash room.

Our tour guide gave some final remarks on the steps.  

As we walked out of the mosque, the weather was just perfect.

We checked out of our hotel and got another Careem to get to the Casa Voyageurs train station, which was the main train station of Casablanca and was further away from us.  Our captain spoke good English and explained to us the differences between the small red taxis and larger white-and-green taxis.  Red taxis can only go to local destinations while the larger ones can go to other places.  William also observed that the larger ones were kept in better conditions in general.  We saw some boys fighting and saw taxi drivers chatting to each other at traffic lights.  However, it was no worse than the condition of some major Chinese cities such as Beijing and Tianjin when I left China over 20 years ago.  We never felt unsafe in China.  Numbers will show Casablanca is a safer place.

## The Train Ride

Our six-seats quarter was occupied by a family of three, an middle-age man, and us.  A young man from France was taking one seat but later moved out as he had no to the adjacent quarter as he had no ticket.  Two hours into our journey, a local old man angrily stopped another young man with American accent, accusing him of cheating him out of his seats.  Obviously the young man told the old man he had a ticket to the same seat.  So far it seemed all the outlaws were foreigners.  There was no air-conditioning.  It was hot.

The little girl was very cute.  She was about four or five years old and was doing homework through the entire journey.  She also tried to practice her English with me.  The old man was sleeping all the way, using a towel to cover his face from the lights.

We crossed the Oum Er-Rbia River, we saw deserts.

## Marrakesh

When our train reached Merrakesh station, passengers for the next trip were already waiting to get on.  We quickly departed the carriage.

Careem does not work in Merrakesh.  Just in case, we also tried Uber which did not work.  The taxi in Marrakesh is tricky, as we have been warned by literally every travel site.  From our observation, they operated more like mini-vans that collect passengers on their way.  Or, an endless  Uber-Pool with autonomous-control.  

Thanks to Google Map, we got on the bus, which took us to the Jamaa El Fna stop.  It was as close as we can get to our hotel, a traditional riad embedded deep into the old city or medina.

Getting off our bus, we passed by a small park with plants and flowers, and almost get lost in a big square where we saw people with monkeys and snake charmes with real cobras! They were many sources of competing loud music and we would later learn that they would go on the entire day and night.

## The Riad

![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49001922828_389b658a06_z.jpg)

While our path following the Google map got narrower and narrower, we wandered around to find our riad.  A riad is a traditional style of Moroccan house with an interior courtyard or a garden.  There was no obvious path to the hotel as the way it is marked on the Google Map.  The back alleys that lead to the deep medina are not on the map at all.  An old man sitting at the door of a _Hotel Saleme_ noticed we looked lost and helped us with directions.  Without his help, we would be in a big trouble.

The door was tightly closed but it opened in two seconds after we knocked.  An old woman greeted us with smiles.  She showed us a booking records in a big notebook, without saying a word.  We did not find our names.  She then led us to a beautiful living area and showed us to sit.  Then she went to the kitchen.  After a long while, she emerged with a tray of mint tea in a delicate teapot.  The tea was very good.  Mint tea is the most sought after bebida in Morocco.  You tell the quality of a mint tea by the smell, taste, and the thickness of the color.

The woman made a few phone calls and we sat there waiting.  After another long while, another woman rushed in.  She showed us the same notebook, and flipped pages for many more records and asked us to find our names.  We couldn't find our name.  Obviously both women couldn't read.  She made a few more phone calls while we continued to wait.  

The courtyard of the riad is occupied entirely by a pool that you can step down, which is completed with a fountain on the wall.  The office is at the right next to the entrance door.  The living area is to the left.  A small dining area is next to the pool with walls decorated with two old guns.  There are an abundance of artifacts at every possible places and they are all there for a reason.  They are all tastefully chosen and contributed to the overall Moroccan aroma.  I saw two guests left their room on the first floor and took a picture.  From where they stood, the courtyard looked like this:

After a while, the first woman gestured us to follow her.  We were shown our room on the second floor.  It was the Atlas room.  She then showed us a shaded rooftop patio that had a view of the square.

We believe we picked a riad that was most beautiful and we believe many other guests made the selection based on the pictures posted online.  One thing we could say after staying there was that all the pictures did not adequately presented the true beauty and aura of the riad.

## The Souk

A souk is a traditional Arabic market embedded in stone-walled narrow alleys.  The people in the medina are craftsmen living on selling their skills to visitors.  The souk is the most dynamic and energetic part of city with strict rules inside but no rules at all for guests to rely on.

People around the world are attracted to cities like Marrakesh and Fez for the souk experience of seeking and finding gems then bagaining for a good price.

The medina is an example of _coexistence-and-excellence_.  I saw a passing by moped bumped over a pile of merchants by accident while navigating the crowded ally but didn't realize it.  A guy from the next shop just came over and picked them up.  Nobody said a thing and no one was angry.  Life continues on.

There are so many cats in the ally.  They are not bothered by the crowd at all.

## The Square

![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49002984441_fc4c762810_z.jpg)

The Jemaa el-Fna Square is the de facto center of the city.  It is exotic in the day and cosy  at night.  

![]( https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49003166382_b74ceeaae0_z.jpg)

The backdrop is the Atlas Mountains, which stretches around 1,600 miles through Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia.  From near to afar, you see the square, the medina, and the Atlas.

We walked into one of a few restaurant on the edge of the median with a good view of the square in setting son.


Two Chinese looking youth took a table next to ours.  I asked them, and they said they were from Hong Kong.  I have ran into many youth from Hong Kong traveling alone before, in London, in Braga, and other places in their gap year.  A Wall Street Journal  news article [revealed](https://www.wsj.com/articles/hong-kong-tops-list-of-donors-to-u-s-schools-1411401637) that Hong Kong was the third largest donor to the US education institutions.  Between 2007 and 2013, Hong Kong donated $181 million to U.S. colleges, after U.K. ($147.6 million) and Canada ($136 million) but before India ($97.5 million), Saudi Arabia ($97 million) among others.  For reference, China donated $60.4 million and Japan donated $56.5 million in the same time frame.  I have full confidence in the vision of generations of Hong Kong people.  They will thrive.
