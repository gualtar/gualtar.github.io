Contrary to some online articles, the origin of the name Casablanca is Portuguese, not Spanish.  I was happy to learn that as it seems to make it closer to home.

We woke up to the magnificence of the Hassan II Mosque from our balcony:

The hotel breakfast was impressive with plenty of various local flavors and made-to-order omelet.  I saw two young women enjoying their breakfast in  very dressy dresses and minutes later saw them again checking-out with 80L daypacks.  Only in Morocco, I guess.

## The Hassan II Mosque

We walked toward the mosque but obviously it was not the common tourists entry.  There were policemen with full-length assault rifles guarding the place.  They saluted to some senior officers as they drove by checking security.  We saw a large number of armed soldiers and policemen at the airports, rail stations, and palaces.  

The mosque only accept grouped tours.  For those do not come with a tour guide, a guide is provided at certain times in a day.  We arrived at around 9:20.  While waiting for our tour at 10, we visited a small museum at the visitor center.  We saw some tourists entered the museum without purchasing a ticket.  They were located by the security and escorted out of the property.

The museum talked about the construction of the mosque with samples of materials and styles.  It is a good source of information, which will be appreciated even more after visiting the actual mosque.

Close to 10 am, people started gathering around the entrance which was located to the west side of the main hall.  Some lined up to take photos with mosaic-decorated fountains.  From afar, we can see the El Hank lighthouse in the morning mist.  It was built in 1916 and towering at 167 ft high.

People were started letting in the mosque.  There were posted signs for tourists speaking different languages.  While waiting for people to gather, we ran into a young man from Colorado who was traveling alone.  He said he had been in Morocco for ten days and would go to Fez in the afternoon.  I asked about his experience in Marrakesh.  He said he just ignored all the locals who had hassled him into things and tricks.

The main hall is amazing.  It holds 20,000 men, with capacity for additional 5,000 women in a separate hall.  It was deigned by a French architect who was the friend of the king and made of all Morocco materials except the chandeliers and two white columns.  

Afterwards, we were led to the level beneath which was a huge wash room.

As we walked out of the mosque, the weather was just perfect.

We checked out of our hotel and got another Careem to get to the Casa Voyageurs train station, which was the main train station of Casablanca and was further away from us.  Our captain spoke good English and explained to us the differences between the small red taxis and larger white-and-green taxis.  Red taxis can only go to local destinations while the larger ones can go to other places.  William also observed that the larger ones were kept in better conditions in general.  We saw some boys fighting and saw taxi drivers chatting to each other at traffic lights.  However, it was no worse than the condition of some major Chinese cities such as Beijing and Tianjin when I left China over 20 years ago.  We never felt unsafe in China.  Numbers will show Casablanca is a safer place.

## The Train Ride

Our six-seats quarter was occupied by a family of three, an middle-age man, and us.  A young man from France was taking one seat but later moved out as he had no to the adjacent quarter as he had no ticket.  Two hours into our journey, a local old man angrily stopped another young man with American accent, accusing him of cheating him out of his seats.  Obviously the young man told the old man he had a ticket to the same seat.  So far it seemed all the outlaws were foreigners.  There was no air-conditioning.  It was hot.

The little girl was very cute.  She was about four or five years old and was doing homework through the entire journey.  She also tried to practice her English with me.  The old man was sleeping all the way, using a towel to cover his face from the lights.

We crossed the Oum Er-Rbia River, we saw deserts.

## Marrakesh

When our train reached Merrakesh station, passengers for the next trip were already waiting to get on.  We quickly departed the carriage.

Careem does not work in Merrakesh.  Just in case, we also tried Uber which did not work.  The taxi in Marrakesh is tricky, as we have been warned by literally every travel site.  From our observation, they operated more like mini-vans that collect passengers on their way.  Or, an endless  Uber-Pool with autonomous-control.  

Thanks to Google Map, we got on the bus, which took us to the Jamaa El Fna stop.  It was as close as we can get to our hotel, a traditional riad embedded deep into the old city or medina.

Getting off our bus, we passed by a small park with plants and flowers, and almost get lost in a big square where we saw people with monkeys and snake charmes with real cobras! They were many sources of competing loud music and we would later learn that they would go on the entire day and night.

## The Riad

While our path following the Google map got narrower and narrower, we wandering around to find our hotel.  A helpful old man sitting at the door of another hotel helped us with directions.

We believe we picked a riad that was most beautiful and we believe many other guests made the selection based on the pictures posted online.  One thing we could say after staying there was that all the pictures did not adequately presented the true beauty and aura of the riad.

## The Souk

A souk is a traditional arabic market embedded in stone-walled narrow alleys.  The people in the medina are craftmen living on selling their skills to visitors.  The souk is the most dynamic and energic part of city with strick rules inside but no rules at all for guests to rely on.

People around the world are attracted to cities like Marrakesh and Fez for the souk experience of seeking and finding gems then bagaining for a good price.

The medina is an example of _coexistence-and-excellence_.  I saw a passing by moped bumped over a pile of merchants by accident while navigating the crowded ally but didn't realize it.  A guy from the next shop just came over and picked them up.  Nobody said a thing and no one was angry.  Life continues on.

There are so many cats in the ally.  They are not bothered by the crowd at all.

## The Square

The Jemaa el-Fna Square is the de facto center of the city.  It is exotic in the day and cosy  at night.
