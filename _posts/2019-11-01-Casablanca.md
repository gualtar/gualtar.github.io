Contrary to some online articles, the origin of the name Casablanca is Portuguese, not Spanish.  I was happy to learn that as it seems to make it closer to home.

We woke up to the magnificence of the Hassan II Mosque from our balcony:

The hotel breakfast was impressive with plenty of various local flavors and made-to-order omelet.  I saw two young women enjoying their breakfast in  very dressy dresses and minutes later saw them again checking-out with 80L daypacks.  Only in Morocco, I guess.

We walked toward the mosque but obviously it was not the common tourists entry.  There were policemen with full-length assault rifles guarding the place.  They saluted to some senior officers as they drove by checking security.

The mosque only accept grouped tours.  For those do not come with a tour guide, a guide is provided at certain times in a day.  We arrived at around 9:20.  While waiting for our tour at 10, we visited a small museum at the visitor center.  We saw some tourists entered the museum without purchasing a ticket.  They were located by the security and escorted out of the property.

The museum talked about the construction of the mosque with samples of materials and styles.  It is a good source of information, which will be appreciated even more after visiting the actual mosque.
