We received a letter from the President, a nice pat on the back.

On a separate note, another Fulbrighter noticed a schedule change on the agenda for the orientation next week at the US Embassy in Lisbon.  We were supposed to be received by Ambassador George Glass, a political appointee and a Trump donor.  It appears he has other important tasks at the same time.
