title: Rainy Days
---

It's the first day when rain caused problem in our morning routine.

It seems we are totally unpreprared for the never-ending rainy winter days in Braga.  If I were to offer anyone who will visit Braga between October and January, the must-have list should include following items:

- A fedora;
- A trench coat;
- A pair of tactical pants;
- A pair of hiking boots;
- A water-proof hiking backpack

Today when I waked to the exit door preparing to get off the bus, an old man stopped me.  Seeing I carrying two backpacks he thought I was going to the train stration, which was a few stops away.  The man does not speak Ingles, and he had to get the help from a young woman to tell me that.  What a nice and considerate person.
