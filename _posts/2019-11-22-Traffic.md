We got up late and it was raining hard.  Fortunately, Uber was still available.  However, a six minutes wait turned into 12 minutes.  The driver took a short cut we still got to the CLIB on time.

William did not feel well and we did not go to swimming.

There was an _Exchange_ event tonight right where we lived.  I forgot about it.  Anna later posted a picture of the night on the Ex-Pats group.  I asked her about the surgeon from Boston whom I met the first time at an Exchange event.  Anna said she did not see him.
