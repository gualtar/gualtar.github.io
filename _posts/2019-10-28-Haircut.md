William got a haircut today from a very talented barbeiro Pedro at the Praga Barbearia.  Pedro's profile picture on their website reads _young boy from the province fetish for fur_.  Their business is very good.  You can never get a walk-in haircut or an appointment for the next day.  However, the day after tomorrow will work.  That's actually a pattern we have observed in Portugal, that people rush to make appointments for the next day.

I messed up my schedule and had to miss a Portuguese class.  Nos texted me the homework (T.P.C.).  

Braga has an extensive bus system.  A city of 136,000 (2011, UN), many routes can carry you to anywhere you want.  In the city center where we live, often you will see a few dozen or more routes on the sign of one bus stop.  However, after hours bus schedule is highly unpredictable.  This evening after William's swimming practice, we waited in rain for half hour while 88 and 2 did not come.  A 63 emerged from the darkness unexpectedly but did not stop because we were too slow to tell from the dim glow of its LED board.

We got an Uber in the end.  The driver drove a bit too fast in the rain and had to break hard a couple of times.
