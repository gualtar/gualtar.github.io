We selected Casablanca because Morocco was the closet place out of the Schengen Visa area.  We had never heard of Marrakesh until Dr. Biswas reminded us of it.  Having completed our Morocco trip, we were so lucky to have gone to Marrakesh; otherwise it would be like not having gone to Morocco at all.

##The Train Ride

Some traveling journals warned the rail system in Morocco was unreliable and unpredictable.  My experience was the opposite.  For the two short distance trains and two long distance trains we took, they were all right on-time.  The railroad employees were very helpful and everyone we had interacted for one reason or another spoke excellent English.  

Following advices from travel blogs, we took first class seats.  The carriage was spacious and comfortable.   The price was very good at about $10 for a first class trip from Casablanca to Marrakesh.  The trip took two and half hours to travel 240 km.

##Getting Around in the City

Within minutes after arrival, we could tell hiring a taxi in Marrakesh was as tricky as described by other tourists.  We launched Google Map and it showed we could take three buses to get to our hotel.  The bus came right on-time and the ticket cost about 50 cents.  William rode free as a child.
