The blog by Xinlian Liu and William Liu on their academic journey in Portugal

### More Information

It started as Xinlian was granted a Fulbright Scholar in Data Science to study Data-driven Machine Learning at University of Minho in Braga and the INESCTEC in Porto, Portugal. University of Minho has two campuses in Guimaraes and in Gualtar, which is a parish in the municipality of Braga.  Hence, the name of this Blog.

In the mean time, William attends the Colegio Luso Internacional de Braga (CLIB), which is about 17 minutes to the northeast of the university campus by foot.  

Besides work and study, we also travel to nearby cities to get exposed to Porugues culture.  

In addition to using the mobile app Duolinguo, we also took Portugues lessons from SPEAK.
